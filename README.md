# Neural Engineering Projects
This repository contains several projects in the Neural Engineering Projects folder. The folder is split up into 2 subfolders, Course Projects and IEEE EMBC 23.

# Course Projects
This folder contains projects I completed while enrolled in ECE 6654 (Neural Engineering and NeuroRobotics) at the University of Utah.
All of the projects were group projects, and these projects were made in accordance with requirements and prompts provided by the instructor.
Each project conference proceeding was my own writing, as each group member had to turn in a separate report. With the exception of Project 2 where 
data from another study was collected for us, the rest of the data was collected in class by my groups and I. The 4 projects are described below.

1) Evaluating virtual hand surface electromyography (sEMG) based control algorithms 
2) Decoding motor intent from Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (USEAs) using an artificial neural network (ANN)
   Note: for this project both the participant data and ANN were provided to us by our instructor, our project was to train the ANN
4) Adjusting transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) parameters to affect perceived intensity
5) Adjusting functional electrical stimulation (FES) paramaters affect grip strength

# IEEE EMBC 2023
This folder contains a published IEEE conference proceeding that I wrote and my associated presentation for the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC). The conference proceeding and presentation discusses my preliminary work exploring the EMG characteristics of post-stroke upper-limb hemiparesis. These files provide a summary of the work I did while I was a Graduate Research Assistant in the Utah NeuroRobotics Lab and a Ph.D. student in the Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program at the University of Utah.
